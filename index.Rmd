### About Me

<p>

I am currently a consultant for **The World Bank** on projects within the Poverty and Equity Team and the Gender Innovation Lab.

I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from **Tilburg University**, and have worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the **University of California, Berkeley** (at the Center for Effective Global Action, **CEGA**).

A recent version of my **CV** is available <a href="files/Rueschenpoehler_CV_May2021.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Research Interests    

<p>

I am interested in understanding how individuals' social environments shape their economic decisions. I primarily use field experiments to examine the role of local knowledge, social learning, preference formation, and the effects and evolution of social norms as determinants and consequences of conditions of poverty.
