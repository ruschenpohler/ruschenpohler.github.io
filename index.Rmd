### About Me

<p>

I am currently a consultant for **The World Bank** on projects within the Poverty and Equity Team and the Gender Innovation Lab. I am also a Global Priorities Fellow at the Forethought Foundation.

I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from **Tilburg University**, and have until recently been a postdoctoral researcher at the **University of California, Berkeley** (at the Center for Effective Global Action, **CEGA**).

A recent version of my **CV** is available <a href="files/Rueschenpoehler_CV_July2021.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Research Interests    

<p>

I study how individuals' social environments shape their economic decisions. Specifically, I am interested in individuals' interactions with public policy. I primarily use field experiments to investigate the role of social norms, beliefs, and identity with the aim to foster local governance and to inform sustainable development policy.


**Primary Interests**
