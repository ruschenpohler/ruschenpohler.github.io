### About Me

<p>

I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Global Poverty Research Lab (**GPRL**) at the Kellogg School of Management, **Northwestern University**. I am interested in the evidence-to-policy nexus, evidence aggregation, causal inference, and inclusive finance.

I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from Tilburg University. Prior to joining Northwestern, I was a research fellow at the Center for Effective Global Action (CEGA) at University of California, Berkeley.

A recent version of my **CV** is available <a href="files/Rueschenpoehler_CV_Jan2025.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Research Interests    

<p>

I study how individuals' social environments shape their economic decisions. Specifically, I am interested in how individuals interact with public policy and in how such insights may usefully inform policy making. I primarily use field experiments to investigate the role of social norms, belief formation, and identity.
