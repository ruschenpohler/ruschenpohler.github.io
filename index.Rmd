### About Me

<p>

I am a **postdoctoral researcher** at the **University of California, Berkeley**, affiliated with the Center for Effective Global Action (**CEGA**).

I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from Tilburg University where I am affiliated with the Experimental Economists at Tilburg.

A recent version of my **CV** is available <a href="files/JRUE_CV_May2020.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Research Interests    

<p>

I am interested in understanding how individuals' social environments shape their economic
decisions. I primarily use field experiments to examine the role of local knowledge, social learning,
preference formation, and the impact and evolution of social norms and local institutions as
determinants and causes of conditions of poverty.
