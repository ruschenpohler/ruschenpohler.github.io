### About Me

<p>

I am currently a consultant for **The World Bank** on projects within the Poverty and Equity Team and the Gender Innovation Lab. I am also a **Global Priorities Fellow 2021/2022** at the Forethought Foundation in collaboration with the Global Priorities Institute at Oxford University.

I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from **Tilburg University**, and have until recently been a postdoctoral researcher at the **University of California, Berkeley** (at the Center for Effective Global Action, **CEGA**).

A recent version of my **CV** is available <a href="files/Rueschenpoehler_CV_July2021.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Research Interests    

<p>

I study how individuals' social environments shape their economic decisions. Specifically, I am interested in how individuals interact with public policy and in how such insights may usefully inform policy making. I primarily use field experiments to investigate the role of social norms, belief formation, and identity.


**Primary Interests**
