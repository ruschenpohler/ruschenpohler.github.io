### About Me

I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from **Tilburg University**, and have worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the **University of California, Berkeley** (at the Center for Effective Global Action, **CEGA**).

### Research Interests    

<p>

I am interested in understanding how individuals' social environments shape their economic decisions. In recent work, I study how individuals react to and interact with public policy, and how such insights can be incorporated into policy design. I primarily use field experiments to examine the role of local knowledge, social learning, and the effects and evolution of social norms in settings marked by resource constraints.


**Primary Interests**
